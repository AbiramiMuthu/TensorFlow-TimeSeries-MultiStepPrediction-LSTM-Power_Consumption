# TensorFlow-TimeSeries-MultiStepPrediction-LSTM-Power_Consumption
Predicting House hold Power consumption using Multi step Prediction-LSTM

1) The dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption
2) Tried predicting the 'Active power consumption' column using the Multi step LSTM
3) with the values of 7 days we tried predicting the values of the next 7 days
4) after prediction the ROOT MEAN SQUARE value of a day is less than the standard deviation of the day, Hence concluding as a good model
